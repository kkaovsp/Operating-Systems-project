# Real-Time Facial Emotion Detection using YOLOv8 + System Performance Monitoring

This project implements a real-time facial emotion detection system using **YOLOv8** combined with **system performance monitoring tools** such as `psutil`, `torch`, and `OpenCV`. It runs on both **CPU and GPU** environments and compares their performance in terms of **FPS, CPU usage, memory usage, and GPU memory (if applicable)**.

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project was developed as part of an Operating Systems coursework to:
- Demonstrate real-time image processing using YOLOv8.
- Compare system performance on different hardware setups (Mac M2, Colab GPU, and Windows with NVIDIA GPU).
- Log and analyze key metrics like CPU%, memory%, GPU memory, and FPS.
- Design modular, maintainable, and well-documented code with robust error handling.

- The diagram shows the data flow from **camera/video input → YOLOv8 model → annotated output**.
- System stats are gathered using `psutil` and overlaid on the output or logged in CSV.

## 🖥️ Code 1: Real-Time Detection from Webcam (`main.py`)

### Description
- Uses OpenCV to open webcam.
- Runs YOLOv8 model on each frame.
- Shows FPS, CPU usage, RAM usage, and GPU memory (if available).
- Displays the annotated webcam output in a live window.

### Key Features
- Real-time emotion detection.
- Monitors system performance.
- Clean exit using `'q'` key.

### Sample Output

```
🔧 Running on: cuda
CPU: 45.2% RAM: 58.7% FPS: 24.1 GPU Mem: 212.3 MB
```

### Code Highlights

```python
model = YOLO("runs/detect/train/weights/best.pt")
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
cpu_percent = psutil.cpu_percent()
fps = 1 / (time.time() - start_time)
```
#### Convert to RGB for YOLO
```python
rgb_frame = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
```

#### Run YOLO prediction
```python
results = model.predict(rgb_frame, device=0 if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu", verbose=False)
```

#### Annotate detections
```python
annotated_frame = results[0].plot()
bgr_frame = cv2.cvtColor(annotated_frame, cv2.COLOR_RGB2BGR)
```

#### System stats
```python
cpu_percent = psutil.cpu_percent()
ram_percent = psutil.virtual_memory().percent
fps = 1 / (time.time() - start_time)
```

#### Apple GPU or GPU CUDA (if any)
```python
if torch.cuda.is_available():
  gpu_mem = torch.cuda.memory_allocated() / 1024**2  # MB
else:
  gpu_mem = 0  # macOS Metal GPU is not shown via PyTorch
```

## 🧪 Code 2: Offline Video Analysis on Google Colab (`Create_CSV_from_CPU_and_GPU.ipynb`)

### Description
- Loads pre-recorded video (e.g., `.MOV`, `.mp4`).
- Processes each frame with YOLOv8.
- Measures FPS, CPU%, RAM%, and GPU memory.
- Saves stats into a CSV file for benchmarking.

### Use Case
- Helpful for environments where live webcam is not available (like Google Colab).
- Useful for running performance comparisons between CPU and GPU.

### Upload file
```python
uploaded = files.upload()
```

### CPU working
```python
cpu_csv = run_yolo_on_video("cpu", max_frames=100)
files.download(cpu_csv)
```

### GPU working
##### Click Runtime > Change runtime type > GPU
```python
gpu_csv = run_yolo_on_video("GPU", max_frames=100)
files.download(gpu_csv)
```

### Output
- Two CSV files:
  - `stats_cpu_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv`
  - `stats_gpu_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv`

### FBS Comparison between CPU and GPU, running on Google Colab
**The graph shows that the GPU performs better.**

### Code Snippet

```python
writer.writerow(["Frame", "FPS", "CPU_Usage", "RAM_Usage", "GPU_Memory_MB"])
gpu_mem = torch.cuda.memory_allocated() / 1024**2 if torch.cuda.is_available() else 0
```
